# Nutil-To-Usable

Please read the N2U protocol if it is your first time using the app as it will guide you step by step in how to use the app. It will also provide descriptions on the more specific/confusing elements so please refer to it if you get lost.

This app is also hosted as a Shiny application at the following link for ease of use:  https://hndlab.shinyapps.io/Nutil-To-Usable/

To site this application you can use the DOI 10.5281/zenodo.10626455. It is also located at https://zenodo.org/records/10626455.

An upgraded version of this application now exists at https://github.com/vari-bbc/Mouse-to-Usable_M2U. This version combines the simple heatmap from this app with the anatomical heatmap of MBH in a simple UI. It works much better with non-nutil data as well, though explicitly only works with mouse data as the anatomical heatmaps are only for mouse. If you are working with mouse data I would highly recommend using that application as it is much more debugged than this.
